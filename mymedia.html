            My favorite movie is salaar.main characters of the movie is prabhas, sruthi hasan and prithvi raj.
            It is directed by prashanth neel. He is one of the finest directors in India. He is known for 
            his previous works Kgf and Kgf2. Salaar is about a story how two friends named devaratha raisaar and varadha rajmannar
