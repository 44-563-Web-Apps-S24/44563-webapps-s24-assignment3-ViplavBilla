            I like a new song called quafirana from kedarnath movie. It is one of the best song i have ever heard.
            It is starred by Sushanth Singh Rajput and sara ali khan. It is a hindi song from kedarnath movie.
            It is written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Arjith singh is the singer for this song.

            My favorite movie is salaar.main characters of the movie is prabhas, sruthi hasan and prithvi raj.
            It is directed by prashanth neel. He is one of the finest directors in India. He is known for 
            his previous works Kgf and Kgf2. Salaar is about a story how two friends named devaratha raisaar and varadha rajmannar
            changed the fate of a place called khaansar. How the two friends became enemies and what happened to them.
            It has several parts, currently salaar is the first movie.
